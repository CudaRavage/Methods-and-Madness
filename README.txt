Homework

The exercise was to make a program that had a method to create an array, a method to reverse the array, and a method to print
all that mess. I can make a functional program from within the Main method, but I can't understand doing it this way.
My book completely skipped any useful information about overloading methods and the available information online sucks out loud.
I provided the code that the author thinks I should be able to come up with ( I don't comprehend it). And I included
my pathetic attempt to give you an idea of where my current ability lies. 

I'm cold as dicks and getting frustrated. I'm going to go hide in bed for the rest of the night 
but if you can guide me in the right direction I would be most appreciative.
